Deployment logs allow you to see the output of building and deploying your code on our CI servers. Thereâ€™s currently no button to easily get them from the Console UI, but you can alternatively use the link next to the GitHub deployment info for a commit.

## Deployment Log URL

When a commit in a pull request is deployed, you get a link that points to the deployed preview app, and another link to the build logs.

![deploy log - PR](../../../assets/images/deploy-log-PR.webp)

You can also get the same detail from the GitHub deployment history page. To do that:

1. Go to the GitHub repository and click the link to the environment you want to see.

![deployment - repo home](../../../assets/images/deployment-repo-home.webp)

2. Click the **deploy** link for the deployment you want to see the log. You should be taken to the build logs page.
